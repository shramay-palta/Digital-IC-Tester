1) The difference between the three proteus project files is only the ICs used to test the simulation (i.e., the 7408, 7432 and 7486). The remaining design and code is identical.

2) For the simulation to run, the LCD needs to be provided a pulse. So we have to stop the simulation after starting it, and then change the position of the switch. Resuming the simulation would enable the LCD, and the tester would work.
